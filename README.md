# Auto-completion-Kubectl
Enable Auto-completion for Kubectl in a Linux Bash Shell

In this short post, we will demonstrate how to install kubectl, setup up auto-completion, and set an alias for kubectl in your bash shell.

When using kubectl commands to interact with your Kubernetes cluster (K8S), auto-completion can be very useful to avoid having to reference a cheat sheet constantly!

Setting an alias for kubectl on the command line, (commonly as k ), also helps save a lot of time when managing your cluster, and is also recommended for the CKA administrator exam as it is very time limited.

# Install Kubectl on Linux

1. Open your bash shell. Type kubectl. If you see the message ‘kubectl: command not found’, follow these steps to install kubectl. If it is installed, skip to Step 7.
2. Download the latest kubectl release with the command:


```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

3. Download the checksum file:

```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
```

4. Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file:

```
echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
```

5. Install kubectl:

```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```
6. Type kubectl . You should now see the tool is installed.

# Set up Auto-completion

7. Check if bash-completion is already installed:

```
type _init_completion
```

If it is already installed, you will see something like the following:

If it is not installed, install using apt or yum, depending on which package manager you are using (usually apt for Ubuntu):

```
apt-get install bash-completion 
```
or
```
yum install bash-completion
```

8. Set the kubectl completion script source for your shell sessions:

For all users on the system:

```
kubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl > /dev/null
```

9. Reload your bash shell. Type kubectl - followed by pressing tab twice to see the available options and verify auto-complete is working:

# Set Up an Alias for Kubectl and Enable for Auto-completion

10. Set an alias for kubectl as k.

```
echo 'alias k=kubectl' >>~/.bashrc
```

11. Enable the alias for auto-completion.

```
echo 'complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k' >>~/.bashrc
```

12. Reload your bash shell. Type k - followed by pressing tab twice to see the available options and verify auto-complete is working with the alias.

```
sudo service ssh restart && exit 
```

you can login again and enjoy deploying your k8s fast

Summary
Enabling auto-completion for kubectl and setting an alias will save you time!
